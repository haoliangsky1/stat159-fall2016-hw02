This folder contains two files:

*eda-script.R* reads in the *Advertising.csv* data set, and computes summary statistics and histograms of TV and Sales, saving the results to *data* and *images* folders;

*regression-script.R* reads in the Advertising.csv data set, and computes a "regression" object as well as the summary of such regression object. This script also produces the scatterplot with the regression line, saving the results to *data* and *images* folders.
