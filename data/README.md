This folder contains three files: 

*Advertising.csv* is the original dataset; 

*eda-output.txt* stores the summary statistics for *TV* and *Sales*; 

and *regression.RData* is an R's binary format file containing the regression object obtained and used in this project.

The raw data of this project is greatly contributed by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani. Without their kindly data opening, none of the analysis would be possible. 

Furthermore, the data *Advertising.csv* could be found [here](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/Advertising.csv).
